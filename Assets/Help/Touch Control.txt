All the adjustments are in the Main Camera, in the "Touch Controller" Script.

The "Touch Tolerance" determines the sensitivity between selecting an object and moving the camera around, it's default is at 0.05f
The "Border Limit" is the distance from the border of the Scrollable plane that limits the movement of the camera.
	NOTE: The Scrollable Plane is the surface our player characters can walk. It has to be centered and if it's rezised, it must have it's navigation mesh rebaked.
The Rotation Speed feels natural around 0.7f
The Zoom Speed feels fine above 2f.
If you want you can deactivate Rotate and set the fixed Camera Angle from the "Camera Follow" Script
